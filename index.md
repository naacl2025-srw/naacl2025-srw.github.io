# Welcome to NAACL SRW 2025
The NAACL Student Research Workshop (SRW) 2025 will be held in conjunction with [NAACL 2025](https://2025.naacl.org/) in Albuquerque, New Mexico, from **April 30 - May 1**.

The SRW gives student researchers in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing the opportunity to present their work and receive constructive feedback and mentorship by experienced members of the ACL community. 

Contact us via email at [naacl25-srw-chairs@googlegroups.com](mailto:naacl25-srw-chairs@googlegroups.com) for any questions.
Get connected with us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/naacl_srw).

<!-- ### List of the accepted papers are available [here](/accepted) -->


<!-- # Differences from Past SRWs -->
Similar to past SRWs, NAACL 2025 SRW has two submission options--archival (appear in proceedings) and non-archival (only for presentation).
Authors can elect for both research papers and thesis proposals to be non-archival, in order to more explicitly encourage work in progress which can later be submitted to a future (archival) conference.
From a mentorship and reviewing standpoint, archival and nonarchival submissions are treated the same.
See the call for papers for more details.

# Anti-Harassment Policy
The NAACL Student Research Workshop 2025 adheres to the [ACL anti-harassment policy](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Anti-Harassment_Policy). Please contact any current member of the [ACL Executive Committee](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/about) or [Priscilla Rasmussen](mailto:acl@aclweb.org) if you face any harassment or hostile behavior.
