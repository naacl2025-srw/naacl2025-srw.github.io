# Grants for Travel and Conference Registration
TBD

<!--
For students who are authors of papers accepted to the NAACL SRW, please fill out the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZ3RfQI7ATSB7hwPk7bWc45TXuQaMY_FLg0r7ZxN-N3trQiQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to request a grant to offset some portion of your conference registration, travel, and accommodation expenses. **The deadline for applying for an SRW grant is May 20.** 
We will be prioritizing funding students who have accepted papers, are attending their first conference, and demonstrate financial need.
